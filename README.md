## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later (as specified in the build workflow)
- Visual Studio 2022 (for development)
- An active AWS Account with an S3 bucket and IAM user credentials.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AWSS3Sync.git
cd AWSS3Sync
```

### 2. Configure AWS Settings
Before running the application, you must create a configuration file named `appsettings.json` in the project's root directory (`AWSS3Sync/`).

**Important**: In Visual Studio, right-click the `appsettings.json` file in the Solution Explorer, select "Properties", and set **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy if newer** or **Copy always**.

The file should contain your AWS credentials and S3 bucket details:
```json
{
  "AWS": {
    "AccessKey": "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
    "SecretKey": "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
    "Region": "your-s3-bucket-region", 
    "BucketName": "your-s3-bucket-name"
  }
}
```

### 3. Build and Run in Visual Studio
1.  Open the `AWSS3Sync.sln` file in Visual Studio 2022.
2.  Visual Studio should automatically restore the required NuGet packages.
3.  Press `F5` or click the "Start" button to build and run the application.

## üì¶ Building a Standalone Application

You can publish the application as a standalone executable that can be run on any Windows machine, even without the .NET SDK installed.

### Using the Command Line (Recommended)
Open a terminal or PowerShell in the project's root directory (`AWSS3Sync/`) and use the `dotnet publish` command.

**To create a self-contained single-file executable for 64-bit Windows:**
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```
The output will be located in `bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/`. The file `AWSS3Sync.exe` can be distributed and run.

**Command Explained:**
- `-c Release`: Builds the project in Release mode.
- `-r win-x64`: Specifies the target runtime is 64-bit Windows.
- `--self-contained true`: Includes the .NET runtime in the executable, so it doesn't need to be pre-installed on the target machine.
- `-p:PublishSingleFile=true`: Packages the application and its dependencies into a single `.exe` file.

### Using the Visual Studio Publish Wizard
1. **Right-click the `AWSS3Sync` project** in Solution Explorer ‚Üí "Publish".
2. **Target**: Select "Folder" for local deployment.
3. **Location**: Choose a folder where the published files will be saved.
4. **Publish options**:
   - **Deployment mode**: `Self-contained`
   - **Target runtime**: `win-x64`
   - Check `Produce single file`.
5. **Publish**: Click "Publish" to generate the executable in the specified folder.
